  25 to 97 of the Harmonized System and referred to in Regulation (EEC)
  N° 3033/80, subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall apply to customs duties

  - the provisions on import formalities applied by the Community to
  third countries,

  from the other Party's application, in respect of imports from third
  countries, of customs duties, quantitative restrictions or any
  measures having equivalent effect, or of any other measure of
  commercial policy, threaten to deflect trade or to cause economic
  difficulties

  in its territory, it may bring the matter before the

  Joint Committee, which shall, if necessary, recommend appropriate
  methods for avoiding any harm liable to result therefrom.

  2. Where deflections occur or economic difficulties arise and the
  Party concerned considers that they call for immediate action, that
  Party may itself take the necessary surveillance or protection
  measures, notifying the Joint Committee without delay; the Joint
  Committee may recommend that the said measures be amended or
  abolished.

  3. In the choice of such measures, preference shall be given to those
  which least disturb the operation of the customs union and, in
  particular, the normal development of trade.</article>
