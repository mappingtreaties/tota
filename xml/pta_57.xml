  import into Lebanon of products originating in the Community shall be
  progressively abolished in accordance with the following schedule:

  2. In the event of serious difficulties for a given product, the
  schedule applicable under paragraph 1 above may be reviewed by the
  Cooperation Council by common accord on the understanding that the
  schedule for which the review has been requested may not be extended
  in respect of the product concerned beyond the maximum transitional
  period of 12 years. If the Cooperation Council has not taken a
  decision within 30 days of an application by Lebanon to review the
  schedule, Lebanon may suspend the schedule provisionally for a period
  which may not exceed one year.

  3. For each product concerned, the basic duty to be gradually reduced
  as provided in paragraph 1 shall be the rates referred to in Article
  15.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 6" article_identifier="6788">The provisions concerning the abolition of customs duties on imports
  shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 7" article_identifier="6789">1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the
  provisions of Article 5 may be taken by Lebanon in the form of an
  increase or reintroduction of customs duties.

  2. These measures may only concern new and infant industries, or
  sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties,
  particularly where these difficulties entail major social problems.

  3. Customs duties on imports into Lebanon of products originating in
  the Community that are introduced by such exceptional measures may not
  exceed 25 % ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for
  products originating in the Community. The total value of imports of
  the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 20 %
  of the yearly average of total imports of industrial products from the
  Community during the last three years for which statistics are
  available.

  4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five
  years unless a longer duration is authorised by the Cooperation
  Council. They shall cease to apply at the latest on the expiry of the
  maximum transitional period of 123 years.

  5. No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more
  than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and
  quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having equivalent
  effect concerning that product.

  6. Lebanon shall inform the Cooperation Council of any exceptional
  measures it intends to adopt and, at the request of the Community,
  consultations shall be held on the measures and sectors concerned
  before they are implemented. When adopting such measures Lebanon shall
  provide the Cooperation Council with a schedule for the elimination of
  the customs duties introduced under this Article. This schedule shall
  provide for a phasing-out of these duties in equal annual instalments
  starting no later than the end of the second year following their
  introduction. The Cooperation Council may decide on a different
  schedule.

  7. By way of derogation from provisions of paragraph 4, the
  Cooperation Council may exceptionally, to take account of the
  difficulties involved in setting up new industries, endorse the
  measures already taken by Lebanon pursuant to paragraph 1 for a
  maximum period of three years beyond the 12 year transitional period.</article>

  liberalisation of their trade in agricultural, fisheries and processed
  agricultural products, of interest to both parties.</article>

  on importation into the Community shall be subject to the arrangement
  set out in that Protocol.

  2. Agricultural products originating in the Community listed in
  Protocol 2 on importation into Lebanon shall be subject to the
  arrangement set out in that Protocol.

  3. Trade in processed agricultural products falling under this chapter
  shall be subject to the arrangements set out in Protocol 3.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 11" article_identifier="6793">1. Five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the
  Community and Lebanon shall assess the situation in order to determine
  measures to be applied by the Community and Lebanon one year following
  the revision of this Agreement, in accordance with the objective set
  out in Article 9.

  2. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 1 and taking
  account of the volume of trade in agricultural, fisheries and
  processed agricultural products between the two Parties and the
  particular sensitivity of such products, the Community and Lebanon
  shall examine on a regular basis in the Cooperation Council, product
  by product and on an orderly and reciprocal basis, the possibility of
  granting each other further concessions.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 12" article_identifier="6794">1. In the event of specific rules being introduced as a result of the
  implementation of its agricultural policy or of any alteration of the

  provisions relating to the implementation of its agricultural policy,
  the Party concerned may amend the arrangements resulting from the

  Cooperation Council thereof. At the request of the other Party, the
  Cooperation Council shall meet to take due account of the interest of

  arrangements made by this Agreement for agricultural products, they
  shall accord imports originating in the other Party an advantage
  comparable to that provided for in this Agreement.

  be the subject, at the request of the other Party, of consultations
  within the Cooperation Council.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13" article_identifier="6795">1. Both Parties agree to cooperate to reduce the potential for fraud
  in the application of the trade provisions of this Agreement.

  2. Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, where one Party
  finds that there is sufficient evidence of fraud such as a significant
  increase in trade products by one party to the other party, beyond the
  level reflecting economic conditions such as normal production and
  export capacities, or failure to provide administrative cooperation as
  required for the verification of evidence of origin by the other
  Party, both Parties shall enter into consultations immediately to find
  an appropriate solution. Pending such a solution, the Party concerned
  may take the appropriate measures it deems necessary. In the selection
  of the measure priority must be given to those which least disturb the
  functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement.</article>

  applied vis-à-vis the Community on the day of conclusion of the
  negotiations.

  2. In the event of the accession of Lebanon to the WTO, the applicable
  rates for imports between the Parties shall be the WTO bound rate or
  lower effectively applied rate enforced as of the date of the
  accession. If, after the accession to the WTO, a tariff reduction is
  applied on an erga omnes basis, the reduced rate shall apply.

  3. The provision laid down in paragraph 2 is of application for any
  tariff reduction applied after the day of conclusion of the
  negotiations on an erga omnes basis.

  such consultations shall take place so as to ensure that account can
  be taken of the mutual interests of the Community and Lebanon.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 19" article_identifier="6801">If one of the Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with
  the other Party in line with prevailing international rules as defined
  in Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  1994 and related internal legislation, it may take appropriate
  measures against this practice in accordance with the WTO Agreement on
  the implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994 and related internal

  other Party in line with prevailing international rules as defined in
  Articles VI and XVI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) 1994 and related internal legislation, it may invoke
  appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with those
  rules as defined by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing
  Measures and related internal legislation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21" article_identifier="6803">1. The provisions of Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the WTO
  Agreement on Safeguards and related internal legislation are
  applicable between the Parties.

  2. Before applying safeguard measures as defined by international
  rules, the Party intending to apply such measures shall supply the
  Cooperation Council with all relevant information required for a
  thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a
  solution acceptable to the Parties.

  In order to find such a solution the Parties shall immediately hold
  consultations within the Cooperation Council. If, as a result of the
  consultations, the Parties do not reach an agreement within 30 days of
  the initiation of the consultations on a solution to avoid the
  application of the safeguard measures, the Party intending to apply
  safeguard measures may apply the provisions of Article XIX of the GATT
  1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.

  3. In the selection of safeguard measures pursuant to this article,
  the Parties shall give priority to those, which cause least
  disturbance to the achievement of the objectives of this Agreement.

  4. Safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Cooperation
  Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within the
  Cooperation Council, particularly with a view to their abolition as
  soon as circumstances permit.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 22" article_identifier="6804">1. Where compliance with the provisions of Article 14(4) leads to:

  (a) re-export to a third country against which the exporting Party
  maintains, for the product concerned, quantitative export
  restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent
  effect; or

  (b) a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to
  the exporting Party;

  and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to
  give rise, to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party
  may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance
  with the procedures laid down in paragraph 2.

  2. The difficulties arising from the situations referred to in
  paragraph 1 shall be submitted for examination to the Cooperation
  Council. The Cooperation Council may take any decision needed to put
  an end to the difficulties. If it has not taken such a decision within
  30 days of the matter being referred to it, the exporting party may
  apply appropriate measures on the exportation of the product
  concerned. The measures shall be non-discriminatory and shall be
  eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 23" article_identifier="6805">Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude prohibitions or restrictions
  on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public
  morality, public policy or public security; of the protection of
  health and life of humans, animals or plants; of the protection of
  national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value; of
  the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property; of
  rules relating to gold and silver and conservation of exhaustible
  natural resources. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not,
  however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised
  restriction on trade between the Parties.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 24" article_identifier="6806">The concept of "originating products" for the application of
  the provisions of the present title and the methods of administrative
  cooperation relating thereto are laid down in Protocol 4.</article>

  Community or Lebanon respectively may, in conformity with the
  conditions laid down within the framework of the GATT and Articles
  VIII and XIV of the Statutes of the International Monetary Fund, take
  restrictive measures with regard to current payments if such measures
  are strictly necessary. The Community or Lebanon, as appropriate,
  shall inform the other Party immediately thereof and shall provide as
  soon as possible a timetable for the removal of such measures.
